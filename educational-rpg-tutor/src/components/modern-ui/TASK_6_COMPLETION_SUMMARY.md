- **TouchInteractionDemo.tsx**: Interactive touch gesture demonstration

**Key Features:**
- Multi-touch gesture support (swipe, pinch, tap, double-tap, long-press)
- Haptic feedback integration with customizable vibration patterns
- Device capability detection and performance tier assessment
- Mobile-optimized animation timings and easing
- Touch target optimization for accessibility
- Gesture conflict resolution and proper event handling

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient Layout Calculations**: Optimized algorithms for masonry positioning
- **Device Adaptation**: Automatic performance scaling based on device capabilities
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and timers
- **Animation Optimization**: Reduced complexity on low-end devices

### Accessibility Features
- **Touch Target Sizing**: Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and focus management
- **Reduced Motion Support**: Respects user motion preferences
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for all interactions

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern CSS Features**: CSS Grid with Flexbox fallbacks
- **Touch API Support**: Graceful degradation for non-touch devices
- **Vibration API**: Safe handling of missing haptic feedback capabilities
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Comprehensive browser compatibility

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- **ResponsiveGrid.test.tsx**: 11 test cases covering all grid configurations
- **FlexGrid.test.tsx**: 12 test cases for flexbox layout variations
- **MasonryGrid.test.tsx**: 13 test cases for masonry layout functionality
- **useTouchGestures.test.ts**: 13 test cases for gesture recognition
- **TouchOptimized.test.tsx**: 14 test cases for touch wrapper component
- **mobileAnimations.test.ts**: 23 test cases for mobile utilities

### Performance Tests
- **ResponsiveGridPerformance.test.ts**: 6 performance benchmarks
- **MasonryGridPerformance.test.ts**: 8 performance optimization tests

### Test Results
- ✅ All responsive grid tests passing
- ✅ All touch gesture tests passing  
- ✅ All performance benchmarks within acceptable limits
- ✅ Cross-device compatibility verified

## Demo Components

### Interactive Demonstrations
1. **ResponsiveGridDemo**: Showcases different grid types and responsive behavior
2. **MasonryGridDemo**: Demonstrates dynamic content management and animations
3. **TouchInteractionDemo**: Interactive touch gesture testing and haptic feedback

### Features Demonstrated
- Real-time breakpoint detection and display
- Dynamic item addition/removal with smooth animations
- Touch gesture logging and haptic feedback testing
- Performance monitoring and device capability detection

## Integration Points

### Design System Integration
- Consistent with existing glassmorphic design components
- Seamless integration with GlassCard and GlassButton components
- Unified animation system with existing motion components

### Theme System Compatibility
- Responsive to theme changes and color schemes
- Consistent spacing and typography scales
- Dark mode and high contrast support

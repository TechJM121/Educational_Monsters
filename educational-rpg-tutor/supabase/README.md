# Supabase Database Setup for Educational RPG Tutor

This directory contains the complete database schema, migrations, and seed data for the Educational RPG Tutor application, including advanced progression tracking and adaptive question systems.

## üöÄ Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Choose a strong database password and save it securely
3. Wait for the project to be fully initialized (this may take a few minutes)
4. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API to find your project credentials

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root directory
2. Update the environment variables with your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

4. **XP Calculation**: Verify XP is awarded correctly for correct answers
5. **Level Progression**: Test level-up functionality and stat point allocation

### Advanced Feature Tests
```sql
-- Test adaptive question selection
SELECT * FROM get_adaptive_question(
    (SELECT id FROM users LIMIT 1),
    (SELECT id FROM subjects WHERE name = 'Mathematics'),
    '7-10'
);

-- Test daily goals tracking
SELECT update_daily_goals_progress(
    (SELECT id FROM users LIMIT 1),
    25, 3, 10
);

-- Test learning streak updates
SELECT update_learning_streak(
    (SELECT id FROM users LIMIT 1),
    'daily'
);
```

### Security Tests
1. **RLS Policies**: Verify users can only access their own data

3. **Parental Access**: Test parent-child data access permissions
4. **Input Validation**: Test function parameter validation

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

**Migration Order Problems**
- ‚ùå Running migrations out of order will cause foreign key errors
- ‚úÖ Always run migrations in the numbered sequence (001, 002, 003...)
- ‚úÖ If you encounter errors, drop all tables and start fresh

**Environment Variable Issues**
```bash
# Verify your .env file has the correct format
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ... (starts with eyJ)
```

**Extension Issues**
```sql
-- Ensure required extensions are enabled
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgcrypto";
```

**RLS Policy Issues**
- All tables have RLS enabled by default
- Test policies using different user contexts
- Use the Supabase Auth UI to create test users

### Function Debugging

**Test Functions Individually**
```sql
-- Test XP calculation
SELECT calculate_xp_for_level(5);
SELECT calculate_level_from_xp(500);

-- Test question processing
SELECT process_question_response(
    'test-user-id',
    'test-question-id',
    'correct answer',
    30
);
```

**Common Function Errors**
- `SECURITY DEFINER` is required for functions that bypass RLS
- Check function parameter types match table column types
- Verify all referenced tables and columns exist

### Performance Optimization

**Index Usage**
```sql
-- Check if indexes are being used
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM questions WHERE subject_id = 'uuid-here';
```

**Query Performance**
- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to identify slow queries
- Consider adding indexes for frequently queried columns
- Monitor database performance in Supabase dashboard
